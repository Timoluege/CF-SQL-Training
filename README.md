# CF-SQL-Training

This repository contains SQL queries that I created during CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Course.

The objective was to learn SQL by exploring, cleaning and analyzing data from the fictional "Rockbusters" online video rental company. The project included:
* Exploratory Data Anaylsis
* Summarizing and cleaning data in SQL
* Analysing the dataset
* Visualizing some of the data in Tableau
* Summarizing key findings in a presentation
