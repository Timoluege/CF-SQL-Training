# CareerFoundry SQL Course
This repository contains SQL queries that I created during CareerFoundry's Data Analytics Course.
The objective was to learn SQL by exploring, cleaning and analyzing data from the fictional "Rockbusters" online video rental company. 

## Data Set
The data set contains information about Rockbuster’s ﬁlm inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. 
[See data dictionary](https://github.com/Timoluege/CF-SQL-Training/blob/main/Exercise%203.10%20Rockbuster%20Data%20Dictionary.pdf)

### The project included the following steps:
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Summarizing and cleaning data in SQL
* Analysing the dataset with SQL 
* Visualizing some of the data with Tableau
* Presenting key findings in a presentation

## Tools
Excel, DBvisualizer, DataGrip, PostgreSQL pgAdmin, Tableau 

## Visualization
For analysis and visualisations please visit my public Tableau profile showing a [performance analysis of different film genres](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timo.luege/viz/CFExercise3_10GenreAnalysis/GenreAnalysis) and [revenue and customers by country](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/timo.luege/viz/CFExercise3_10Rockbusters/RevenuebyCountry) or [look at the powerpoint presentation in PDF-format](https://github.com/Timoluege/CF-SQL-Training/blob/main/Exercise%203.10%20Rockbuster%20Data%20Analysis%20Presentation.pdf).
